# Cancer-prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to develop a predictive model utilizing Logistic Regression to discern whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Data requirement:
To ascertain whether a tumor is malignant or benign, a substantial amount of data is available. Several factors contribute more significantly to the prediction, and they are:
1. Radius mean
2. Perimeter mean
3. Area mean
4. Concavity mean
5. Concave points mean
(for my model I used data from Kaggle)

## Data correlations

## Results
1. model score = 0.92
2. the confusion matrix:
